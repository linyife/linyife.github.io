## Research Interests

- Greenhouse Gas Mitigation
- Environmental-Economic-Energy Systems Modeling
- Feasibility Analysis of Net-Zero Emissions

My current research focuses on the feasibility analysis of achieving net-zero emissions in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, a region of critical ecological and climatic significance.  With a dual degree in Environmental Science and Energy & Environmental Systems Engineering, I combine problem-driven environmental research with technology-driven engineering solutions to address this complex challenge.

I am committed to becoming a versatile researcher who can contribute to innovative solutions for global sustainability.  My ultimate goal is to use my skills and knowledge to promote well-being and a sustainable future, starting with the fragile yet vital ecosystems of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
